\title{Clean character encoding text.}
\usage{
cleanEncoding(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{String characters of unknown encoding}
}
\value{
String characters of UTF-8 encoding
}
\description{
Often when importing plain text files the character encoding is unknown and sometimes of mixed origin. This poses a problem with special characters such as foreign species author names or hybrid symbols. This crude script uses tools from the stringi package to detect non UTF-8 encoding such as Window's 'latin1' and convert it to UTF-8. At best, incorrect encoding will render nonsense characters, while at worse, it will cause functions to crash.

\examples{
x= '� Pachgerocereus orcuttii' # Example data correctly encoded by default, but this is how incorrect rendering may look.
x= cleanEncoding(x)
'× Pachgerocereus orcuttii' # This is how the above text should have been correctly rendered, if it were an actual data encoding error.
